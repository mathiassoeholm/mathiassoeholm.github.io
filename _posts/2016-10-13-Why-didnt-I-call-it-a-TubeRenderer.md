title: Why didn’t I call it a TubeRenderer?
---

In my [previous post](https://mathiassoeholm.github.io/Cylindrical-LineRenderer/), I presented the Cylindrical Line Renderer. It turns out that there’s a name for a cylindrical line. It’s called a tube! I feel pretty stupid for not calling my CylinderRenderer for TubeRenderer.

It even turns out that if you Google TubeRenderer, someone already made a contribution to the [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/3281). It looks better than what I made, but it costs $10.

Anyway.. I updated the name, and also added the option to have two radii, similar to Unitys LineRenderer.

You can get the updated version [here](https://gist.github.com/mathiassoeholm/15f3eeda606e9be543165360615c8bef).

And here’s a pretty picture made with the TubeRenderer:
